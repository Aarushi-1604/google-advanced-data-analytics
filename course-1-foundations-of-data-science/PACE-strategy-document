# Course 1 – Foundations of Data Science  
**Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**

---

## Instructions

This PACE strategy document records decisions and reflections made during the end-of-course project.  
It is used to plan the project by identifying the audience, stakeholders, milestones, goals, and workflow.

This document also serves as a reusable reference for future data analytics projects.

---

## Course Project Recap

Regardless of the track selected, the goals of this project are:

- Complete a **PACE Strategy Document** to plan the project while considering audience members, teammates, key milestones, and the overall goal.
- Create a **project proposal** for the data team.

---

## Relevant Interview Questions

Completing this project prepares you to answer questions such as:

- As a new member of a data analytics team, how would you get up to speed on an existing project?
- How would you plan an analytics project?
- How do you translate a business question into an analytical solution?
- Why is actively managing data important for analytics teams?
- What should be considered when reporting results to stakeholders?

## Data Project Questions & Considerations  
### PACE Stage: **Plan**

### 1. Who is the audience for this project?

The **primary audience** is TikTok’s data team, including the Data Science Manager and Data Scientists.  
They require detailed and technical information about the data, modeling approach, and analysis.

The **secondary audience** includes cross-functional stakeholders such as Project Management, Operations, Finance leadership, and Executives.  
They require high-level summaries, insights, and visualizations rather than technical depth.

---

### 2. What are you trying to solve or accomplish?

The goal of this project is to support the development of a **machine learning model** that can reliably classify TikTok content as either a **claim** or an **opinion**.

This work will help TikTok:
- Reduce the backlog of user-reported content
- Prioritize content that requires moderator review
- Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Trust & Safety operations

---

### 3. What questions need to be asked or answered?

Key questions include:

1. What data is available to differentiate claims from opinions?
2. Which features or variables are most useful for classification?
3. Does the dataset contain missing, inconsistent, or biased information?
4. Which modeling approach is best suited for this task?
5. How accurate and reliable is the final model?

---

### 4. What resources are required to complete this project?

Resources required beyond the dataset include:

1. Access to TikTok’s content and user-interaction databases  
2. Python programming environment and relevant libraries  
3. Computing resources for large-scale data analysis  
4. Collaboration with data scientists, project managers, and operations stakeholders  
5. Time allocated for EDA, modeling, testing, and communication  

---

### 5. What are the project deliverables?

Key deliverables include:

1. A project proposal outlining milestones, tasks, and workflow  
2. Cleaned and documented datasets  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) findings and visualizations  
4. Results from statistical and hypothesis testing  
5. A trained and evaluated machine learning model  
6. A summary of insights and recommended actions  
7. Visual materials to support stakeholder presentations  

---

## The PACE Workflow

The PACE framework consists of four stages:

- **Plan** – Define the problem, stakeholders, goals, and workflow  
- **Analyze** – Explore data and compute statistics  
- **Construct** – Build models and prepare data artifacts  
- **Execute** – Evaluate models and communicate insights  

---

## Project Tasks Mapped to PACE Stages

### 1. Evaluating the model — **Execute**

Model evaluation occurs after model development and focuses on assessing performance, validating results, and ensuring project goals are met.

---

### 2. Conduct hypothesis testing — **Analyze & Construct**

- **Analyze** to explore relationships and test assumptions  
- **Construct** to formally implement statistical tests and interpret results  

---

### 3. Begin exploring the data — **Analyze**

Initial exploration helps identify patterns, distributions, and potential issues that guide later analysis and modeling decisions.

---

### 4. Data exploration and cleaning — **Analyze & Construct**

- **Analyze** to identify missing values, outliers, and data quality issues  
- **Construct** to implement cleaning steps and prepare data for modeling  

---

### 5. Establish project workflow (PACE) — **Plan**

Defining the workflow early helps organize tasks, timelines, and responsibilities before analysis begins.

---

### 6. Communicate final insights — **Execute**

This stage focuses on delivering findings, insights, and recommendations to stakeholders after analysis and modeling are complete.

---

### 7. Compute descriptive statistics — **Analyze**

Descriptive statistics summarize key characteristics of the data and support early understanding before inferential analysis.

---

### 8. Visualization building — **Analyze & Execute**

- **Analyze** to explore trends and relationships  
- **Execute** to present finalized visuals for stakeholder communication  

---

### 9. Write a project proposal — **Plan**

The project proposal defines scope, objectives, and milestones and must be completed before execution begins.

---

### 10. Build a regression model — **Construct & Execute**

- **Construct** to design, train, and validate the model  
- **Execute** to apply the model and assess its real-world performance  

---

### 11. Compile summary information about the data — **Analyze**

Summarizing data supports informed decisions about modeling and analytical approaches.

---

### 12. Build a machine learning model — **Construct**

The Construct stage focuses on developing, training, and refining the machine learning model.
