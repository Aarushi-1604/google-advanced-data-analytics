# COURSE 1: FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE

This course is not about coding or tools yet. It is rather about **thinking like a data professional**

In this course I learnt:
- What data professionals actually do in real companies
- How data teams work cross-functionally with business leaders, stakeholders, and clients
- How business problems are turned into data problems
- How to clearly define a problem before directly jumping into analysis
- Why communiation and structure matter in corporates as much as technical skills
- How to ask the right questions so that analysis leads to real business impact

## The Course Project: TikTok Workplace Scenario
Instead of coding problem statements, this course gave an actual workplace scenatio.
I was placed into the role of a **data professional** at TikTok. The leaderhip wants to use data to better understand what is happening on the platform and make informed business decisions/
The project does not start with data collecting or preprocessing right away. Instead, it starts with understanding:
- The business problem TikTok is facing
- The teams and stakeholders involved in the project

## Understanding the Problem at TikTok
TikTok hosts massive volumes of user-generated content where some includes **claims** while others contain **opinions**.
TikTok wants to better understand and manage the content at a large scale.
The problem arrives - Mannualy reviewing all content is NOT scalable.
The comapny needs a data-driven way to:
- Identify videos that contain **claims**
- Distinguis them from **opinions**
- Support content moderation, trust and safety efforts

## What the Project wants us to do
The project essentially requires us to design and build a workflow that can:
- Analyze TikTok video data
- Classify content as **claims** or **opinions**
- Generate insights to support decision-making
- Eventually develop a statistical and machine learning models for the classification

## The PACE Framework
The Course 1 Activity follows a PACE Framework, which is used throught the certificate:
- **PLAN** - Define the problem, stakeholders, deliverables, and criteria for success
- **ANALYZE** - Explore the data and answer key question, find patterns etc.
- **CONSTRUCT** - Build models, visualization, and derive insights
- **EXECUTE** - Communicate the findings to stakeholders and support business decisions

## What I produced in this course
For this course, I created a **PACE Strategy Document** that outlines:
- The TikTok business problem
- The goal of classifying content
- Key stakeholders
- Project deliverables
- How each PACE stage will be applied

## What next?
In upcoming course, this project will expand to include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Testing
- Visualization and dashboards (using Tableau)
- Regression and Machine Learning tools
- Clear communication and insights to stakeholders
