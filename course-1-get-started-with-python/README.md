# Course 2: Getting Started with Python

## What this course focused on
This course built my foundation in Python for data analysis. I learned how to work with variables, data types, functions, conditionals, loops, and core data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples. I also practiced writing clean, readable Python code that can be easily understood and reused by other data professionals.

Towards the end of the course, I was introduced to NumPy and pandas, two essential libraries used for handling and analyzing structured datasets in real-world data science projects.

## Project context: TikTok claims classification
This course uses a fictional workplace scenario based on TikTok. TikTok’s data team is working on a machine learning system that can classify whether content on the platform contains a **claim** or an **opinion**. This distinction helps moderators prioritize reports and reduce the backlog of user-submitted content that needs review.

As a data analyst on the team, my responsibility in this stage of the project was to prepare the data so it can later be analyzed and modeled.

## What I did in this project
In this course project, I focused on preparing and understanding the TikTok dataset by:
- Building a pandas dataframe from a CSV file
- Inspecting rows and column data types
- Computing descriptive statistics
- Creating basic visualizations in Python
- Organizing the data for future exploratory data analysis
- Communicating progress and findings through an executive summary

This work represents the technical foundation needed before moving on to statistical analysis and machine learning in later courses.

## How this fits into the larger certificate project
This course represents the first technical step in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate capstone. The Python skills and data preparation work completed here directly support later stages of the TikTok claims classification project, including exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning model development.
